# Peakhour-Problem
This is a Peak-hour Problem selected from http://www.sharjah.ac.ae/en/Media/Conferences/ME-GPC/Documents/gpc17%20Problem%20Set.pdf

You can see the full problem description from the above link..
The program is about calculating the peak throughput over all the possible time frames of length T.

#Input Format
The input starts with a number C (1 ≤ C ≤ 100) that represents the number of test cases in the file.
Each test case starts with a line that contains two integers, N (1 ≤ N ≤ 106), and T (1 ≤ T ≤ 109), 
N lines follow with each containing an integer Ni (1 ≤ Ni ≤ 109) representing the time an email is processed in minutes. Multiple emails can be processed in the same minute.

#Output Format
The output for each test case is in this form: k. ans where k represents the test case number (starting at 1), and ans is the peak throughput.
